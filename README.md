# Socket Programming - Word-Counting Client

This assignment was done as part of the COL334 course requirements. The goal of this assignment is to familiarize oneself with socket programming, client-server communication, and scheduling algorithms. The assignment is divided into four parts, with the first two focusing on datagram sockets (single and multi-client handling) using C/C++ programming, and the remaining two focusing on scheduling algorithms (Slotted Aloha, BEB, CSCD, FIFO-Scheduling and Fair-Scheduling).
